# Contributing to the Software Discovery Tool

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Software Discovery Tool! This document explains how to contribute changes to the Software Discovery Tool project. We welcome submissions and appreciate your contributions.

## Contribution Process

To contribute to the Software Discovery Tool, please follow these steps:

1. **Refer to the installation guide for detailed setup instructions: [Installation Wiki Link]**

2. Fork the project on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button on the project's GitHub page.

3. Clone the repository to your local machine. It is recommended to make changes locally instead of editing directly on GitHub, as the online editor may cause issues with JSON formatted data. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openmainframeproject/software-discovery-tool
```

4. Create a new branch with the name **Software-Discovery-Tool-feature_name** and switch to that branch. Make your changes in this branch and commit them with descriptive commit messages. Use the following commands to create the branch and switch to it:

```shell
git checkout -b Software-Discovery-Tool-feature_name
```

5. Push the branch to your forked repository on GitHub. If you made the changes locally, you can use the following command:

```shell
git push origin Software-Discovery-Tool-feature_name
```

6. Create a pull request (PR) against the "master" branch of the original repository. The title of your PR should be descriptive of your changes, for example, "Adding new distribution to the application." In the PR description, provide additional information about the changes and their purpose.

7. All contributions must align with the [Open Mainframe Project contribution guidelines](https://tac.openmainframeproject.org/process/contribution_guidelines.html), including having a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) signoff on all commits. Please make sure your commits include the DCO signoff.

8. Wait for the project maintainers to review your pull request. They may provide feedback or request further changes. If your pull request is not accepted, the reviewer will mention the reason in the PR comments.

For more information on creating a pull request, refer to the [GitHub Help documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Note

Please note that not all pull requests may be accepted. The project maintainers will review your changes and determine their suitability for merging into the main branch. If your contribution is not accepted, the reviewer will provide feedback and explain the reason.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to the Software Discovery Tool, and we value your contributions to the project.

Happy contributing!
