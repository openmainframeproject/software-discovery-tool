Attendees:

## Meeting Notes

 - Welcome to our summer mentee, Arsh Pratap!
 - Refactoring the tool to use a database as a production data store
   - Arsh will spin up a demo instance with Mongo to see about speed, resources, and how easy it will be to refactor SDT
   - If not, maybe try Redis, as Divya suggested
   - Note: We want to use the versions of whatever database come with the OS, rather than pulling down binaries
 - Assigned Arsh to Validated Open Source Software list issue
