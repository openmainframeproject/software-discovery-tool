## Agenda
- Mentee introductions
- 2023 Summer Mentorship overview
    - Prince shared database back-end updates
    - Aashish gave a guided overview of the UI improvements
        - Collected feedback regarding how you select the data sources you want to search for, and how the results are displayed, including descriptions.
        - Divya suggested reducing the amount of “marketing” material for the tool on the main page, maybe one splash image with words to make it look fresh and modern, but otherwise trim it down to focus on the search.
        - Also discussed rendering time for the UI in React, the code needs to be optimized and smaller file size images used.
- Divya encouraged Prince and Aashish to take full advantage of the mentorship program with the speaking opportunities, blog posts, contacts, experience, and more, which Elizabeth can elaborate on.
