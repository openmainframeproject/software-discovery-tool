## Attendees:

 - Elizabeth K. Joseph
 - Arsh Pratap
 - Prince Singh
 - Divya Goswami

## Agenda
 - Current state of the tool
   - Arsh suggested we may want to have the ability to search by package type (ie database) rather than specific names, in case a user isnâ€™t sure exactly what they might need.
     - We should keep this in mind for the UI changes, we want flexibility for other search parameters
 - Project participation in June-August ("Summer") 2024 mentorship program
   - Mentorship link: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/ea44ab21-8b14-4d17-91de-d7a8724483f8
   - Confirmed that we want to keep the scope to finalizing the UI w/ React, and improvements to documentation, likely no work with the data back ends
   - Divya and Elizabeth will be the official mentors, with Arsh and Prince helping as well
 - Next steps for z/OS split
   - Elizabeth will reach out to the z/OS Open Tools team to see if they are interested in doing this work and maintaining the source regularly: https://github.com/openmainframeproject/software-discovery-tool/issues/110
   - Elizabeth will reach out to Lionel to begin discussing how he wants to handle CBT Tape: https://github.com/openmainframeproject/software-discovery-tool/issues/132
 - Issue review/clean-up completed
