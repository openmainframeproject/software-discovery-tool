## Meeting Notes

 - Updates on Arshâ€™s work
   - We switched to using MariaDB/MySQL for the database back end due to MongoDB not working out as expected
   - We now have AlmaLinux as a source! Rocky Linux is almost there, just needs a rebase on the master branch
   - Lyz reviewed the verified software list proposal and gave some feedback, but it looks good: https://github.com/openmainframeproject/software-discovery-tool-data/issues/25
 - For Divya's deploy repository documentation, Lyz has provided some feedback in the PR: https://github.com/openmainframeproject/software-discovery-tool-deploy/pull/9
